Scope of character selection work

✅A static number of characters on screen
✅Represent characters as buttons
We want visual indication as to who has selected a character
If a character has been selected,
   change the text of the button locally to say, "fuckwad selected KIRBY"
   disable button to other users
   if the user that selected the character clicks the button, unselect the character
   free to pick is green 
   unavailable is greyed out red
   blue if I've selected it
   [me, other, available]
I should be able to name myself and change my name
Updates to my name will proliferate to other players, even if I have already selected my character
